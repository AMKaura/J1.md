1. What is fault localization? Provide your answer using at least one bolded phrase using markdown.

    Fault localization is using **print statements** to trace our code line by line until we find the bug.

2. What are three benefits of Test Driven Development (TDD)? Provide your answer using an unordered list in markdown.

    - Tests are unbiased by code
    - Creating test cases helps you think about your requirements
    - Writing tests makes you think about how to write your code

3. Using input domain partitioning, write a test set that checks that a method that gives discounts to children and seniors of 50% and 25% respectively works as intended. The input to this method is a single variable, age, and the output is the discount.

    I have partitioned my inputs as follows:
    invalid - less than 0 or greater than 130 (both non-inclusive)
    children - 0 to 17 (both inclusive)
    adults - 18 to 64 (both inclusive)
    seniors - 65 to 130 (both inclusive)
    
    | Input | Output |
    |------=|=-------|
    | -3  | -1 |
    | 18 | 0 |
    | 17 | 0.5 |
    | 120 | 0 |
    | 119 | 0.25 |
    | 65| 0.25 |
    | 0 | 0.5 |
    | Integer.MIN_VALUE | -1 |
    | Integer.MAX_VALUE | -1 |


4. What are the input domain paritions for this exercise? Provide your answer using an unordered nested lists in markdown.

      - At least one number:
        + Input String: abCde Expected Output Boolean: false  
        + Input String: abC1de Expected Output Boolean: true  
        + Input String: 1abCde Expected Output Boolean: true  
        + Input String: abCde1 Expected Output Boolean: true 
        + Input String: abC12de Expected Output Boolean: true 
    - At least one uppercase letter:
        + Input String: abc1d2e Expected Output Boolean: false
        + Input String: ab1CD2e Expected Output Boolean: true
        + Input String: ab1CeD2 Expected Output Boolean: true
        + Input String: ab1eD2c Expected Output Boolean: true
    - At least one lowercase letter:
        + Input String: ABC1D2E Expected Output: false
        + Input String: abC1d2e Expected Output: true
        + Input String: A1B2C3D Expected Output: false
        + Input String: a1B2C3 Expected Output: true
        + Input String: Z9X_Y1 Expected Output: false
    - Must not contain "gmail"
        + Input String: abC1gmail2e Expected Output: false
        + Input String: gmAB1cd Expected Output: true
        + Input String: GMAI1Labc Expected Output: true
        + Input String: abcd1EFG Expected Output: true

5. Imagine you are writing test cases to find the minimum of a list. What are the input domain paritions for this exercise? Provide your answer using an unordered nested lists in markdown.

6. Complete the truth table below to show what inputs we need to achieve active clause coverage for the following conditional:
    if ( ( (a > b) or G ) and (x < y) )

    | a > b | G | x < y | predicate outcome | Clause responsible |
    |-------|---|-------|-------------------|--------------------|
    |   T   | F |   T   |         T         |       a > b        |
    |   F   | F |   T   |         F         |       a > b        |
    |   T   | T |   F   |         F         |         G          |
    |   T   | F |   F   |         F         |         G          |
    |   F   | T |   T   |         T         |       x < y        |
    |   F   | T |   F   |         F         |       x < y        |

7. Consider the control flow graph below. What are all the paths (using node numbers) that would achieve full path coverage as a test criteria? Is this a finite set?

    When listing all the paths, style your answer so that it appears like code (a code-like font with a gray background).

    ```
    1,2,5,7
    1,2,5,6,7
    1,3,4,3,4,3,4,5,6,7
    1,3,4,3,4,3,4,3,4(repeating),5,7
    1,3,5,6,7
    1,3,5,7
    and so on...
    ```

8. What benefit does mutation testing offer over other testing methods discussed in class? Use a link in markdown to link to the definition of mutation testing we have in our lecture notes from today.

    Instead of defining input domains and test sets [mutation testing](https://cs2113-s25.github.io/j/software_testing#:~:text=mutation%20testing%20because%20we%20are%20mutating%20the%20syntactic%20structures%20of%20the%20code%20to%20generate%20bugs%20automatically%20(which%20is%20why%20this%20sort%20of%20testing%20is%20feasibile%20%E2%80%93%20we%20know%20a%20buggy%20file%20should%20change%20the%20output).) mutation testing changes the code a line at a time to generate bugs as we know a buggy file should change the output.
